In this repo I posted some eggs that I spoted during exploring mac terminal, including watching an old movie "star war", playing Ping Pong with your friends, and making a cute cow speak.

However, I do believe I will bring more than a few tricks to people. Coding is hard. We need to relax from time to time. Just put your laptop aside for a while, and talk with your friends, families.

Have a good day!
